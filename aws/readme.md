## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing (CC) is the **on-demand delivery of computing resources** over the internet. Instead of maintaining physical servers, organizations can use virtualized resources as needed.

### Key Concepts

- **Server and Client:**

  - Server: Houses compute power, storage units, networking, and databases.
  - Client: Devices (PCs, mobiles) that access server resources.

- **Cloud Computing Features:**
  - On-demand provisioning of compute, storage, and network resources.
  - Pay-as-you-go model: scale resources up or down based on need.

## Types of Cloud Computing

### 1. Private Cloud

- Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization.
- Offers high security and control.

### 2. Public Cloud

- Shared infrastructure across multiple organizations.
- Cost-effective and scalable.

### 3. Hybrid Cloud

- Combination of private and public clouds.
- Useful for sensitive workloads plus scalable applications.

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- **On-demand Self-Service:** Provision resources automatically without manual intervention.
- **Broad Network Access:** Accessible from any device via the internet.
- **Multi-Tenancy and Resource Planning:** Multiple customers share resources efficiently.
- **Rapid Elasticity and Scalability:** Quickly scale resources up or down.
- **Measured Service:** Usage is monitored, controlled, and billed based on consumption.

---

## Advantages of Cloud Computing

- **Cost Savings:** No need to buy and maintain physical servers.
- **Economies of Scale:** Leverage provider infrastructure for cost efficiency.
- **Capacity Management:** Adjust computing power as demand changes.
- **Speed and Agility:** Deploy applications quickly without hardware delays.
- **Reduced Maintenance:** Cloud provider handles server maintenance and updates.

## Cloud Service Models

### 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

- Provides virtualized computing resources (servers, storage, networking).
- Examples: Amazon EC2, AWS VPC.

### 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)

- Provides platform for building and deploying applications without managing underlying infrastructure.
- Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda.

### 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)

- Delivers software applications over the internet.
- Examples: Amazon WorkSpaces, AWS Chime.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

- **Regions:** Geographically separate areas (e.g., US East, Asia Pacific).
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Multiple isolated locations within a region for high availability.
- **Edge Locations:** Points of presence for content delivery (CDN).

## AWS Services

AWS provides a **wide range of services** across various domains:

- **Compute:** EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk
- **Storage:** S3, EBS, Glacier
- **Databases:** RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift
- **Networking:** VPC, CloudFront, Route 53
- **Security:** IAM, KMS, GuardDuty
- **Analytics & AI/ML:** SageMaker, Athena, Rekognition
- **Developer Tools:** CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CloudFormation

**Scope:** Some services are **global**, some are **regional**. Understanding the scope helps in architecture planning.
